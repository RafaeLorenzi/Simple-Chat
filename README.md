# Simple-Chat
 Concurrent chat server supporting multiple clients.
 
 _The Idea
 
To create a concurrent chat server supporting multiple clients.

_The Development

Using Java I developed the Server and Client applications in small steps, adding features one at a time. The program runs on the console and each client is asked to enter its name. It also supports commands like:


'/list' - show the list of user currently logged.


'/whisper' - send a message to a specific client.


'/quit' - self-explanatory

_Tech && Methodologies

Java, IntelliJ, TCP, Socket, Concurrency, Mac OS, git
